In Memoriam Te Maro
Leading botanist, cultivator and gardener
shot through the heart
by explorers led by James Cook
on 8 October 1769,
the first day of their invasion,
500 years after the nearby landing
of the waka Horouta
coming to Aotearoa from Hawaiki.

In October 1769, Te Maro, a leading Māori cultivator and gardener,
was shot by Cook's crew during their first landing in New Zealand.
His ancestors had been living in New Zealand for more than 500 years.
