## Poster

This poster confronts a European and a Māori perspective of the commemoration
of the 250th anniversary of the arrival of James Cook in New Zealand.

The European perspective celebrates the discovery of New Zealand by James Cook.
It occupies more than half of the surface of the poster (7/12). The text is
set in Helvetica, the iconic typeface of the International Style, with a lot
of white space. The colors of the text and background are taken from the colors
of the flag of New Zealand. The word 'New Zealand' is capitalized and also
emphasized through the use of a white outline which reminds of the outlines
present on the New Zealand flag.

In the center, the Cook 250 occupies the smallest band (2/12). The logo
evokes the Coca-Cola brand through its corporate white and red colors and
its swash lines, as a reference to [coca-colonization][COCACOLONIZATION],
"a process of change that happens everywhere a militarily and/or culturally
advanced culture comes into contact with another culture with the intention
of establishing settlements". The shapes of the logo are also based on the
actual signature of James Cook, which refines the association with the
British colonization initiated through James Cook's exploration.

The logo looks ambiguous. It can be turned around and read with a different
meaning upside down: this is an ambigram. Turning the poster reveals this
opposite meaning, 'sos chaos', and allows to read the text in the Māori
perspective, written upside down compared to the European perspective.

The Māori perspective presents an obituary of Te Maro, the first victim,
of a long list, of explorers lead by James Cook. It occupies the remaining
part of the poster (3/12). This In Memoriam is presented both in Te Reo Māori
and in English, side by side. It puts the European invasion and pretended
discovery of New Zealand with the long voyaging tradition of the Māori
and their much earlier settlement of Aotearoa long before it was renamed
to New Zealand by European explorers.
