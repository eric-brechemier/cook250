### Abel Tasman

[Abel Tasman][TASMAN] was a Dutch explorer employed by the
[Dutch East India Company][VOC] to find the mythical
"Southern Continent" or [Terra Australis][TERRA_AUSTRALIS],
a gigantic land mass expected to cover 1/5th of the world,
which was assumed to be required to keep the Earth in balance.

Leaving Indonesia with two ships, [Heemskerck and Zeehaen][TASMAN_SHIPS],
on 14 August 1642, he arrived at Mauritius on 5 September 1642
then left on 8 October along the [Roaring Forties][ROARING40s].

On 24 November 1642, he sighted the coast of what he assumed to
be Terra Australis. He started to circumvent it from a distance,
keeping at sea due to the rough weather, as multiple attempts
to send men ashore failed. On 2 December 1642, men reached the shore,
trying to find fresh water and provisions: they found a lush vegetation
but only a thin stream with too little water to collect in barrels.
They [heard music and saw traces of people][GIANTS] but did not meet anyone.

> Early in the morning we sent our Pilot-major Francoys Jacobsz in command of
> our pinnace, manned with 4 musketeers and 6 rowers, all of them furnished
> with pikes and side-arms, together with the cock-boat of the Zeehaan with
> one of her second mates and 6 musketeers in it, to a bay situated north-west
> of us at upwards of a mile distance in order to ascertain what facilities
> (as regards fresh water, refreshments, timber and the like) may be available
> there. About three hours before nightfall the boats came back,
> bringing various samples of vegetables which they had seen growing
> there in great abundance, some of them in appearance not unlike a certain
> plant growing at the Cape of Good Hope and fit to be used as pot-herbs,
> and another species with long leaves and a brackish taste, strongly
> resembling persil de mer or samphire. The Pilot-major and the second mate
> of the Zeehaan made the following report, to wit:
>
> That they had rowed the space of upwards of a mile round the said point,
> where they had found high but level land covered with vegetation (not
> cultivated, but growing naturally by the will of God) abundance of excellent
> timber, and a gently sloping watercourse in a barren valley, the said water,
> though of good quality, being difficult to procure because the watercourse
> was so shallow that the water could be dipped with bowls only.
>
> That they had heard certain human sounds and also sounds nearly resembling
> the music of a trump or a small gong not far from them though they had seen
> no one.
>
> That they had seen two trees about 2 or 2½ fathom in thickness measuring
> from 60 to 65 feet from the ground to the lowermost branches, which trees
> bore notches made with flint implements, the bark having been removed for
> the purpose; these notches, forming a kind of steps to enable persons to get
> up the trees and rob the birds' nests in their tops, were fully 5 feet apart
> so that our men concluded that the natives here must be of very tall stature,
> or must be in possession of some sort of artifice for getting up the said
> trees; in one of the trees these notched steps were so fresh and new that
> they seemed to have been cut less than four days ago.
>
> That on the ground they had observed certain footprints of animals, not
> unlike those of a tiger's claws; they also brought on board certain specimens
> of animals excrements voided by quadrupeds, so far as they could surmise and
> observe, together with a small quantity of gum of a seemingly very fine
> quality which had exuded from trees and bore some resemblance to gum-lac.
>
> That round the eastern point of this bay they had sounded 13 or 14 feet at
> high water, there being about 3 feet at low tide.
>
> That at the extremity of the said point they had seen large numbers of gulls,
> wild ducks and geese, but had perceived none farther inward though they had
> heard their cries; and had found no fish except different kinds of mussels
> forming small clusters in several places.
>
> That the land is pretty generally covered with trees standing so far apart
> that they allow a passage everywhere and a lookout to a great distance so
> that, when landing, our men could always get sight of natives or wild beasts,
> unhindered by dense shrubbery or underwood, which would prove a great
> advantage in exploring the country.
>
> That in the interior they had in several places observed numerous trees
> which had deep holes burnt into them at the upper end of the foot, while
> the earth had here and there been dug out with the fist so as to form a
> fireplace, the surrounding soil having become as hard as flint through the
> action of the fire.
>
> A short time before we got sight of our boats returning to the ships, we now
> and then saw clouds of dense smoke rising up from the land, which was nearly
> west by north of us, and surmised this might be a signal given by our men,
> because they were so long coming back, for we had ordered them to return
> speedily, partly in order to be made acquainted with what they had seen,
> and partly that we might be able to send them to other points if they should
> find no profit there, to the end that no precious time might be wasted.
> When our men had come on board again we inquired of them whether they had
> been there and made a fire, to which they returned a negative answer,
> adding however that at various times and points in the wood they also had
> seen clouds of smoke ascending. So there can be no doubt there must be men
> here of extraordinary stature. This day we had variable winds from the
> eastward, but for the greater part of the day a stiff, steady breeze from
> the south-east.

Tasman officially claimed possession of the land on 3 December 1643,
which would later be called Tasmania in his honor, but failed to set foot
on the land himself because of the strong waves close to the shore, he had
to send a man swimming to the shore to plant the pole with the flag.
Two days later, facing opposing winds, he decided to stop the circumnavigation
and failed to discover the strait that separates the island of Tasmania
from Australia. Instead, Tasmania would be drawn as part of Australia
on the [Tasman Map][TASMAN_MAP], drawn circa 1644 based on his charts.

He sailed away, to pursue his search for the missing continent. Pushed east
by the Roaring Forties, on 13 December 1642 he spotted the coast of what
he assumed, once again, to be Terra Australis. Failing to find a suitable
spot to get ashore, he continued to navigate north and east for 5 days,
until 18 December 1642 when they anchored and decided to send a party
to the shore.

> **Item the 18th.**
>
> In the morning we weighed anchor in calm weather; at noon Latitude
> estimated 40° 49', Longitude 191° 41'; course kept east-south-east,
> sailed 11 miles. In the morning before weighing anchor, we had resolved
> with the Officers of the Zeehaan that we should try to get ashore here and
> find a good harbour; and that as we neared it we should send out the pinnace
> to reconnoitre; all which may in extenso be seen from this day's resolution.
>
> In the afternoon our skipper Ide Tiercxz and our pilot-major Francoys
> Jacobsz, in the pinnace, and Supercargo Gilsemans, with one of the second
> mates of the Zeehaan in the latter's cock-boat, went on before to seek a
> fitting anchorage and a good watering-place.
>
> At sunset when it fell a calm we dropped anchor in 15 fathom,
> good anchoring-ground in the evening, about an hour after sunset,
> we saw a number of lights on shore and four boats close inshore,
> two of which came towards us, upon which our own two boats returned on board;
> they reported that they had found no less than 13 fathom water and that,
> when the sun sank behind the high land, they were still about half a mile
> from shore.
>
> When our men had been on board for the space of about one glass the men
> in the two prows began to call out to us in the rough, hollow voice,
> but we could not understand a word of what they said. We however called out
> to them in answer, upon which they repeated their cries several times, but
> came no nearer than a stone shot; they also blew several times on an
> instrument of which the sound was like that of a Moorish trumpet; we then
> ordered one of our sailors (who had some knowledge of trumpet-blowing)
> to play them some tunes in answer. Those on board the Zeehaan ordered their
> second mate (who had come out to India as a trumpeter and had in the
> Mauritius been appointed second mate by the council of that fortress and
> the ships) to do the same; after this had been repeated several times on
> both sides, and as it was getting more and more dark, those in the native
> prows at last ceased and paddled off.
>
> For more security and to be on guard against all accidents we ordered our
> men to keep double watches as we are wont to do when out at sea, and to keep
> in readiness all necessaries of war, such as muskets, pikes and cutlasses.
> We cleaned the guns on the upper-orlop, and placed them again, in order to

> Variation 9° North-East.
>
> **Item the 19th.**
>
> Early in the morning a boat manned with 13 natives approached to about a
> stone's cast from our ships; they called out several times but we did not
> understand them, their speech not bearing any resemblance to the vocabulary
> given us by the Honourable Governor-General and Councillors of India, which
> is hardly to be wondered at, seeing that it contains the language of the
> Salomonis islands, etc.
>
> As far as we could observe these people were of ordinary height;
> they had rough voices and strong bones, the colour of their skin being
> brown and yellow; they wore tufts of black hair right upon the
> top of their heads, tied fast in the manner of the Japanese at the back of
> their heads, but somewhat longer and thicker, and surmounted by a large,
> thick white feather.
>
> Their boats consisted of two long narrow prows side by side, over which a
> number of planks or other seats were placed in such a way that those above
> can look through the water underneath the vessel: their paddles are upwards
> of a fathom in length, narrow and pointed at the end; with these vessels
> they could make considerable speed.
>
> For clothing, as it seemed to us, some of them wore mats, others cotton
> stuffs; almost all of them were naked from the shoulders to the waist.
>
> We repeatedly made signs for them to come on board of us, showing them
> white linen and some knives that formed part of our cargo. They did not
> come nearer, however, but at last paddled back to shore.
>
> In the meanwhile, at our summons sent the previous evening, the officers of
> the Zeehaan came on board of us, upon which we convened a council and
> resolved to go as near the shore as we could, since there was good
> anchoring-ground here, and these people apparently sought our friendship.
>
> Shortly after we had drawn up this resolution we saw 7 more boats put off
> from the shore, one of which (high and pointed in front, manned with 17
> natives) paddled round behind the Zeehaan while another, with 13 able-bodied
> men in her, approached to within half a stone's throw of our ship; the men
> in these two boats now and then called out to each other; we held up and
> showed them as before white linens, etc., but they remained where they were.

> The skipper of the Zeehaan now sent out to them his quartermaster with her
> cock-boat with six paddlers in it, with orders for the second mates that,
> if these people should offer to come alongside the Zeehaan, they should not
> allow too many of them on board of her, but use great caution and be well on
> their guard.
>
> While the cock-boat of the Zeehaan was paddling on its way to her those in
> the prow nearest to us called out to those who were lying behind the Zeehaan
> and waved their paddles to them, but we could not make out what they meant.
>
> Just as the cock-boat of the Zeehaan had put off from board again those in
> the prow before us, between the two ships, began to paddle so furiously
> towards it that, when they were about halfway slightly nearer to our ship,
> they struck the Zeehaan's cock-boat so violently alongside with the stem of
> their prow that it got a violent lurch, upon which the foremost man in this
> prow of villains with a long, blunt pike thrust the quartermaster Cornelis
> Joppen in the neck several times with so much force that the poor man fell
> overboard. Upon this the other natives, with short thick clubs which we at
> first mistook for heavy blunt parangs, and with their paddles, fell upon
> the men in the cock-boat and overcame them by main force, in which fray
> three of our men were killed and a fourth got mortally wounded through the
> heavy blows.
>
> The quartermaster and two sailors swam to our ship, whence we had sent our
> pinnace to pick them up, which they got into alive. After this outrageous
> and detestable crime the murderers sent the cock-boat adrift, having taken
> one of the dead bodies into their prow and thrown another into the sea.
>
> Ourselves and those on board the Zeehaan seeing this, diligently
> fired our muskets and guns and, although we did not hit any of them, the
> two prows made haste to the shore, where they were out of the reach of shot.
> With our fore upper-deck and bow guns we now fired several shots in the
> direction of their prows, but none of them took effect.
>
> There upon our skipper Ide Tercxsen Holman, in command of our pinnace
> well manned and armed, rowed towards the cock-boat of the Zeehaan
> (which fortunately for us these accursed villains had let adrift) and
> forthwith returned with it to our ships, having found in it one of the men
> killed and one mortally wounded.
>
> We now weighed anchor and set sail, since we could not hope to enter into
> any friendly relations with these people, or to be able to get water or
> refreshments here.
>
> Having weighed anchor and being under sail, we saw 22 prows near the shore,
> of which eleven, swarming with people, were making for our ships.
> We kept quiet until some of the foremost were within reach of our guns,
> and then fired 1 or 2 shots from the gun-room with our pieces, without
> however doing them any harm; those on board the Zeehaan also fired,
> and in the largest prow hit a man who held a small white flag in his hand,
> and who fell down. We also heard the canister-shot strike the prows inside
> and outside, but could not make out what other damage it had done. As soon
> as they had got this volley they paddled back to shore with great speed,
> two of them hoisting a sort of tingang sails. They remained lying near the
> shore without visiting us any further.
>
> About noon skipper Gerrit Jansz and Mr. Gilsemans again came on board of us;
> we also sent for their first mate and convened the council, with whom we
> drew up the resolution following, to wit:
>
> Seeing that the detestable deed of these natives against four men of
> the Zeehaan's crew, perpetrated this morning, must teach us to consider the
> inhabitants of this country as enemies;
>
> that therefore it will be best to sail eastward along the coast, following
> the trend of the land in order to ascertain whether there are any fitting
> places where refreshments and water would be obtainable;
>
> all of which will be found set forth in extenso in this day's resolution.
>
> In this murderous spot (to which we have accordingly given the name of
> Moordenaersbay) we lay at anchor on 40° 50' South Latitude, 191° 30'
> Longitude. From here we shaped our course east-north-east.
>
> At noon Latitude estimated 40° 57', Longitude 191° 41'; course kept south,
> sailed 2 miles.
>
> In the afternoon we got the wind from the west-north-west when, on the
> advice of our steersmen and with our own approval, we turned our course
> north-east by north.
>
> During the night we kept sailing as the weather was favourable, but about
> an hour after midnight we sounded in 25 or 26 fathom, a hard, sandy bottom.
> Soon after the wind went round to north-west, and we sounded in 15 fathom;
> we forthwith tacked to await the day, turning our course to westward,
> exactly contrary to the direction by which we had entered.
>
> Variation 9° 30' North-East.
>
> This is the second land which we have sailed along and discovered.
> In honour of their High Mightinesses the States-General we gave
> Staten Landt, since we deemed it quite possible that this land is part
> of the great Staten Land, though this is not certain. This land seems to
> be a very fine country and we trust that this is the mainland coast of the
> unknown South land. To this course we have given the name of Abel Tasman

They then spent several days at anchor in a nearby bay, now called Tasman Bay,
waiting with double anchors for a strong storm to pass, then navigating
for days to find [land on all sides][TRAPPED], and no passage in view.

They escaped on the 26th with favorable wind, then navigated away
[along the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand][MORE_LAND]
until they reached the northernmost tip of the North Island on January 4th.

> **Item the 5th.**
>
> In the morning we still drifted in a calm, but about 9 o'clock we got a
> slight breeze from the south-east, whereupon with our friends of the

>
> About noon we sent to the said island our pinnace with the pilot-major,

> in order to find out whether there was any fresh water to be obtained there.
>
> Towards the evening they returned on board and reported that, having come

>
> that they had entered a safe but small bay, where they had found good fresh
> water, coming in great plenty from a steep mountain, but that, owing to the
> heavy surf on the shore, it was highly dangerous, nay well-nigh impossible
> for us to get water there, that therefore they pulled farther round the
> said island, trying to find some other more convenient water-place elsewhere,
> that on the said land they saw in several places on the highest hills from
> 30 to 35 persons, men of tall stature, so far as they could see from a
> distance, armed with sticks or clubs, who called out to them in a very loud,
> rough voice, certain words which our men could not understand;
>
<> that these persons, in walking on, took enormous steps or strides.
>
> As our men were rowing about some few in number now and then showed
> themselves on the hill-tops, from which our men very credibly concluded
> that these natives in this way generally keep in readiness their assegais,
> boats and small arms, after their wonted fashions;
>
> so that it may fairly be inferred that few, if any, more persons inhabit
> the said island than those who showed themselves;
>
> for in rowing round the island our men nowhere saw any dwellings or
> cultivated land except just by the fresh water above referred to, where
> higher up on both sides the running water they saw everywhere square beds
> looking green and pleasant, but owing to the great distance they could not
> discern what kind of vegetables they were.
> It is quite possible that all these persons had their dwellings near the
> said fresh water.
>
> In the bay aforesaid they also saw two prows hauled on shore, one of them
> seaworthy, the other broken, but they nowhere saw any other craft.
>
> Our men having returned on board with the pinnace, we forthwith did our best
> to get near the shore, and in the evening we anchored in 40 fathom,
> good bottom, at a small swivel-gun-shot distance from the coast. We
> forthwith made preparations for taking in water the next day.
>
> The said island is in 34° 25' South Latitude and 190° 40' average Longitude.
>
> **Item the 6th.**
>
> Early in the morning we sent to the watering-place the two boats, to wit
> ours and the cock-boat of the Zeehaan, each furnished with two pederaroes,
> 6 musketeers, and the rowers with pikes and side-arms, together with our
> pinnace with the pilot-major Francoys Jacobsz and skipper Gerrit Jansz,
> with casks for getting fresh water.
>
> While rowing towards the shore they saw, in various places on the heights,
> a tall man standing with a long stick like a pike, apparently watching our
> men. As they were rowing past he had called out to them in a very loud voice;
>
> when they had got about halfway to the watering-place, between a certain
> point and another large high rock or small island, they found the current
> to run so strongly against the wind that, with the empty boats, they had to
> do their utmost to hold their own;
>
> for which reason the pilot-major and Gerrit Jansz, skipper of the Zeehaan,
> agreed together to abstain from exposing the small craft and the men to such
> great peril, seeing that there was still a long voyage before them and the
> men and the small craft were greatly wanted by the ships. They therefore
> pulled back to the ships, the rather as a heavy surf was rolling on the
> shore near the watering-place.
>
> The breeze freshening, we could easily surmise that they had not been able
> to land, and now made a sign to them from our ship with the furled flag, and
> fired a gun to let them know that they were at liberty to return, but they
> were already on their way back before we signalled to them.
>
> The pilot-major, having come alongside our ship again with the boats,
> reported that owing to the wind the attempt to land there was too dangerous,
> seeing that the sea was everywhere near the shore full of hard rocks without
> any sandy ground, so that they would have greatly imperilled the men and run
> the risk of having the water-casks injured or stove in;
>
> we forthwith summoned the officers of the Zeehaan and the second mates on
> board of us, and convened a council in which it was resolved to weigh anchor
> directly and to run on an easterly course as far as 220° Longitude, in
> accordance with the preceding resolution; then to shape our course to
> northward, or eventually due north, as far as Latitude 17° South, after
> which we shall hold our course due west in order to run straight of
> the Cocos and Hoorense islands, where we shall take in fresh water and
> refreshments;
>
> or if we should meet with any other island before these we
> shall endeavour to touch at them, in order to ascertain what can be obtained
> there; all this being duly specified and set forth at length in this day's
> resolution, to which for briefness sake we beg leave to refer.
>
> About noon we set sail; at noon we had the island due south of us at about
> 3 miles distance;
>
> in the evening at sunset it was south-south-west of us at 6 or 7 miles
> distance, the island and the rocks lying south-west and north-east of

>
> During the night it was pretty calm with an east-south-east wind, our course

Tasman then set hist course further north, leaving New Zealand where neither
he nor any of his men had set foot.

The stretch of the Pacific between Australia and New Zealand,
that Tasman had crossed pushed by the Roaring Forties, locally
dubbed "the Ditch", is officially called the [Tasman Sea][TASMAN_SEA]
in recognition of his first expedition.

On January 19th, he spotted one of the Tonga islands, and had friendly
exchanges with the locals on the 21st:

> **Item the 21st.**
>
> In the morning we had a calm; we had the southernmost island east by south
> of us at about five miles distance; we shaped our course for the northernmost
> island which is in 21° 50' South Latitude, Longitude 205° 29', and sailed to
> the north-west of the island where we dropped anchor in 25 fathom, coral
> bottom.
>
> The place where we came to anchor is in 21° 20' South Latitude and
> Longitude 205° 29'. These two islands are nearly south-east and north-west
> of each other; we could see through between them, where there was a passage
> about 1½ mile in width. The one to the south-east was the highest, the
> northernmost one being a low-lying island, much like Holland. To the
> northernmost we gave the name of Amsterdam because of the abundance of
> refreshments we got there, and the southernmost we christened Middleburch.
>
> At noon a small prow with three men in it put off from land and came near
> our ship; these men were naked, of a brown colour and slightly above the
> ordinary stature; two of them had long, thick hair on their heads, the third
> wore his close cut; they had only their privities covered with a curious
> small bit of cloth; their prow was a very narrow one, covered in to a good
> distance in front and abaft; their paddles were of ordinary length, with
> blades broad in the middle; they called out to us several times, to which
> we responded in the same way, but we could not understand each other.
>
> We showed them white linen, throwing overboard a piece upwards of 1½ fathom
> in length, which they seeing paddled towards it, but as it had sunk to a
> considerable depth under the water the foremost man in the prow jumped out
> and dived for it. He remained under water for a very long time, but at last
> reappeared with the linen and got into the prow again, where he put it
> several times atop of his head, in sign of gratitude.
>
> They then gradually approached us with their prow, upon which we threw out
> to them a piece of wood to which we had fastened two large nails; we then
> handed out to them a small Chinese looking-glass with a string of Chinese
> beads, which they drew up into their prow by means of a long stick, to which
> they tied one of their fish-hooks with a small fishing-line, which they
> handed up to us to show their gratitude. This fish-hook was made of
> mother-of-pearl and shaped like a small anchovy. They repeatedly put the
> string of beads and the looking-glass on their heads; the middlemost man in
> the prow tied the nails round his neck, but as the looking-glass was closed
> with a slide they could not see themselves in it. We therefore handed down
> another to them which they looked into, and laid on their heads.
>
> We now showed them an old coconut and a fowl, and with aid of our vocabulary
> inquired after water, hogs, etc.; they did not understand us nor we them,
> but they constantly kept pointing to the shore.
>
> When we had made them a present of the objects aforementioned, and had shown
> them the coconut and the fowl, they at last paddled back to shore again and
> made signs to us, as if they were going to fetch the like from shore.
>
> At noon and in the afternoon we saw numbers of people walking along the
> shore, some of them with small white flags which we surmised to be signs
> of peace and amity. We therefore also hoisted our white flag astern,
> upon which there came alongside our ship a small prow with four persons in
> it; they were able-bodied men, having their bodies painted black from the
> waist to the thighs, their necks hung round with leaves; they carried a
> small white flag and a cloth made of the bark of trees. They fastened the
> said flag to the stem of our boat. The outriggers of their prow were trimmed
> with shells and conches.
>
> From these presents and from the embellishments of their prow, which seemed
> to be distinguished above the others, we concluded that this prow had been
> sent off by the king or chief of the country. We therefore presented these
> men with a small Chinese looking-glass, a knife, a piece of dungaree, and
> one or two nails.
>
> We filled a rummer of wine for them, from which we first drank ourselves
> lest they should think we were going to poison them or do them other harm;
> having taken the rummer they poured out the wine and took the rummer on
> shore with them.
>
> Shortly afterwards a great number of prows came alongside, some of them with
> 5 or 6, others with 10 or 12 coconuts, all of which we bartered against old
> nails; three or four coconuts against a double middle-sized nail.
> Some of them came swimming from the land with coconuts, all of which we
> bartered with them.
>
> After some time an aged man came on board of us to whom all the others
> paid honour, so that we concluded him to be one of their chiefs. We
> conducted him to the cabin; he did us reverence by inclining his head down
> to our feet; we paid our respects to him in return after our own fashion,
> and showed him a cup with fresh water which he showed us by signs to be
> obtainable on shore; we then presented him with a knife, a small
> looking-glass, and a piece of dungaree.
>
> As they were leaving the cabin one of the natives was caught in the act of
> stealing the skipper's pistol and a pair of slippers. We took these articles
> from him again without showing the least dissatisfaction.
>
> Many of these people had the lower part of the body painted black down to
> the knees, some had a mother-of-pearl shell hanging on the breast.
>
> Towards evening about 20 prows came close to our ships, which all stationed
> themselves side by side in regular order. Before coming alongside they made
> a good deal of noise, crying out repeatedly "Woo, woo, woo," etc., upon
> which those in our ship sat down.
>
> The said prows then came alongside, bringing a present from the king,
> consisting of a fine large hog, a number of coconuts, and some yams; the
> bearer of these presents being the same person who brought us the small
> white flag and the cloth of bark. We presented them in return with a common
> dish such as we use at meals, and a piece of copper-wire; we also bartered
> a few coconuts, baccovos, yams and a hog, etc., against nails and beads;
> about nightfall they all left our ship except one who remained to sleep on
> board of the Heemskerk.
>
> **Item the 22nd.**
>
> Early in the morning again a number of boats came alongside with coconuts,
> yams, baccovos, bananas, hogs and fowls, all of which we bartered with them;

After leaving Tonga, Tasman spotted the Fiji Islands on 6 February 1643,
but did not anchor there and left for New Guinea without any attempt
of exploration.

Back to Indonesia, his expedition concluded on 15 June 1643. His exploration
of the discovered lands was found lacking, and he was sent on a second trip
in 1644 along a different route, and never returned to New Zealand.
