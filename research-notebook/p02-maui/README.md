> Many Europeans were fascinated by Māori mythology.
> One was the German artist Wilhelm Dittmer,
> who visited New Zealand to collect oral traditions.
> He also illustrated many traditions with ink drawings.
> Here Māui, with his frightened brothers clinging to the canoe,
> heaves up the fish that is the North Island.
> The sun, to whom Māui and his brothers are linked
> in another tradition, watches on.
