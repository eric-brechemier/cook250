### Polynesian Navigation

Traditional Polynesian navigation requires a deep knowledge of ocean currents,
waves and swells, algae, winds, clouds, bird flights and fish migrations, as
well as the movements of celestial bodies as seen from different locations.

> In the early 1970s members of the Polynesian Voyaging Society in Hawaii
> searched for Polynesians who remembered traditional navigation techniques.
> At first they thought there was no one, but they eventually tracked down
> Mau Piailug from the island of Satawal in Micronesia, who could navigate
> the open ocean without instruments. He guided the Hōkūle‘a from Hawaii to
> Tahiti and back using a star compass, shown here. Mau Piailug shared his
> knowledge with Nainoa Thompson, who became the first Polynesian in centuries
> to use celestial navigation on long distance ocean voyaging when he repeated
> the journey in the same vessel in 1980.

> Te kapehu whetū – the Māori star compass – divides the 360 degrees
> around a canoe in the open ocean into different whare (houses).
> The location of these houses depends on where the sun, moon and stars
> set and rise. The navigator then attempts to keep the canoe on a course
> relative to these observations.

> Marshall Islands navigation charts were made of sticks tied together.
> Cowrie shells represented the relative positions of islands,
> while curved and diagonal sticks showed swell and wave patterns.
> Today, they are mainly sold as tourist souvenirs,
> but these ancient navigation aids were once vital for island hopping
> between the 1,000 and more islands that make up the Marshalls group.
> The charts were not carried on board, but were memorised.
> They were also used to record collective knowledge
> and to train young navigators.
