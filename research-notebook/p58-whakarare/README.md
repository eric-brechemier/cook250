> (...) Starting with the observation that there are no authentic
> Māori typefaces, designed by Māori for Māori communities,
> Witehira traces the kaupapa Māori design process in which Māori
> cosmo-genealogy is transformed into structural characteristics
> of the Whakarare typeface. In Māori history, the world was created
> when the children of Ranginui (sky-father) and Papatūānuku (earth-mother),
> forcibly push their parents apart.
>
> (...) While the Whakarare typeface is designed to be Māori-centric,
> the authors demonstrate how the problem of designing forms that express
> the concept of compression and crushing, as a status immediately preceding
> an explosive expansion, is not specific to the Māori culture. Every designer
> in the world would face the same design challenge in a completely different
> context. The ability to design a form capable of generating that perception
> in the observer is not a trivial or easy task. On the contrary, its solution
> requires a very advanced knowledge of the psychology of perception and
> therefore has a universal, rather than local, significance.
