> Ralph Hotere began using text in his paintings during the early 1960s,
> and it has since become an important element in his work.
> His ‘Te Whiti Series’ of the early 1970s,
> which includes text from a wide range of sources,
> relates to issues surrounding Pakeha confiscation of Māori land.
> Te Whiti drawing-painting incorporates a Māori lament that refers
> to the First Taranaki War and the ensuing confiscation of Te Atiawa land
> at Waitara by the colonial government in 1860. (...)

> On 5 November 1881, following more than a decade of dispute over
> the confiscation of Te Atiawa land in Taranaki for European settlement,
> 1,600 government troops entered the prosperous settlement of Parihaka
> which lay on flat land between the mountain and the sea.
> The troops encountered 2,500 local people led by spiritual leaders
> Te Whiti-O-Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi, who met the military advance
> with creative acts of passive resistance including singing, skipping,
> and the offering of food.
>
> Over the next 18 days, under the direct order of Native Minister John Bryce,
> the armed constabulary sacked the village and violently ejected more than
> 1,600 people. A six-pound Armstrong gun was mounted on a nearby hill and
> trained on the settlement. Te Whiti-O-Rongomai and Tohu Kākahi were arrested,
> and after six months in jail in New Plymouth, were imprisoned in the South
> Island.

> The story of Parihaka has had a profound effect on New Zealand artists,
> and continues to be explored in song, theatre, literature and the visual
> arts. It is said to have inspired Gandhi's later acts of passive resistance,
> through two Irishmen who had visited Parihaka and later recounted the story
> to him. In 2000, Christchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waiwhetū acquired an
> important work on paper by Ralph Hotere from his 'Te Whiti' series, through
> the estate of artist Bill Sutton. Hotere's 'Te Whiti' works—and many others
> by artists including Colin McCahon—were commissioned for an exhibition
> curated by James Mack at Waikato Art Museum in 1973.
>
> The text Hotere uses is drawn from a lament that marks the beginning of
> the 'days of darkness' of the Taranaki injustices.
>
>   "E kore e pouri tonu Waitara
>    I whakamamaetia i nga ra i mua ra…

>    Darkness will not always cover Waitara /
>    That was caused to suffer pain in days gone by…"
>
> The lament was recorded by Te Rangi Hiroa in his book The Coming of the
> Maori (1949). Hiroa recalled that the lament was often performed in the
> 1890s by members of a drum and fife band established by Te Whiti's followers
> at Parihaka.
>
> Writing at the time of the Parihaka: The Art of Passive Resistance
> exhibition in Wellington in 2001, curator Greg O'Brien noted that Hotere's
> 'Te Whiti' works were originally intended as studies towards larger
> paintings, which were in the end, not realised: the outlined lettering
> was to be replaced by stencilled text in the canvas versions. (...)
