## Research Notebook

This notebook contains 40 sheets (80 pages), with one single picture
on each page, related to European discovery of New Zealand on the
front and offering a differing Māori point of view on the back.

It is based on a physical spiral-bound notebook with 40 black sheets
(80 pages) in landscape format, originally designed for sketching and
reimagined as a photo album.
