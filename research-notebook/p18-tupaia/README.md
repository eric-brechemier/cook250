#### Tupaia guided James Cook from Otaheite towards Aotearoa (1769)

*The navigator drew this chart to explain the relative positions of islands to Joseph Banks and James Cook.*

> Tupaia’s chart from 1769 is evidence of the intricacy and detail
> of Polynesian knowledge of the South Pacific, and a striking contrast
> to the emptiness of the same space in European maps of the time.

> Tupia says that their are several Islands laying at different directions

> to the NE is an Island called Mannua that is Bird Island and that it lies
> four days sail from Ulietea which is one day less then from Ulietea to
> Ohetiroa from this account I shall be able to find the situation of Mannua
> pretty well. Sence we have left Ulietea Tobia Tupia hath been very disireous
> for us to steer to the westward and tells us if we will but go that way we
> shall meet with plenty of Islands the most of them he himself hath been at
> and from the description he gives of two of them they must be those
> discover'd by Captain Wallice and by him call'd Boscawen and Kepple Islands,
> and these do not lay less than 400 Leagues to the westward of Ulietea;
> he says that they are 10 or 12 days in going thither and 30 or more in
> coming back and that their Paheas, that is their large Proes sails much
> faster than this Ship; All this I beleive to be true and therefore they may
> with ease sail 40 Leagues a day or more —
>
> The farthest Island to the southward that Tupia hath been at or knows
> anything of lies but two days sail from Ohetiroa and is called Moutou but
> he says that his Father once told him that their were Islands to the
> southward of it, but we can not find that he either knows or ever heard of
> a Continent or large track of land. I have no reason to doubt Tupia['s]
> information of these Islands, for when we left Ulietea and steer'd to the
> southward, he told us that if we would keep a little more to the East
> / which the wind would not permit us to do / we should see Mannua, but as
> we then steer'd we should see Ohetiroa which happend accordingly. If we
> meet with the Islands to the southward he speaks off it well if not I shall
> spend no more time searching for them. being now fully resolved to Stand
> directly to the Southward in search of the Continent.
