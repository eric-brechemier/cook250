### Aotearoa

> Māori oral history names Kupe as the first explorer to discover New Zealand.
> He and his companion, Ngahue, captained two sea-going waka (canoes),
> Matahorua and Tawiri-rangi, and sailed south from Hawaiki to see
> what lay beyond the horizon.
>
> The first sign of a major land mass was a build up of white cloud
> in the distance. Kupe's wife, Hine-te-aparangi, called out
> "He ao he ao! He aotea! He aotearoa"
> ("A cloud, a cloud! A white cloud! A long white cloud!"),
> and so the land was named Aotearoa—'Land of the long white cloud'.
>
> After circumnavigating the North and South Islands of Aotearoa,
> Kupe and his crew returned to Hawaiki with treasures
> such as preserved moa flesh and pounamu (greenstone).

> It is Kupe who is credited with the discovery of Aotearoa,
> and who returned to the Pacific carrying navigational
> knowledge about the vast new land to the south.
>
> Kupe’s wife, Hine-te-Aparangi, was the first to sight
> the vast land mass that we call Aotearoa.
> “He ao - a cloud!” she called, then “He aotea - a white cloud!”
> and finally “He aotearoa - a long white cloud!”
