*Māori settlers left East Polynesia for Aotearoa from 1250 onward*

> The vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean was explored and settled
> by sailing large double-hulled canoes from island to island.
> The ancestors of Māori are likely to have sailed from East Polynesia
> in these craft.

> Since the late 20th century there have been several intriguing areas
> of research into both the origins of Māori and their date and mode
> of arrival. Radiocarbon dating of archaeological settlement sites,
> analysis of volcanic ash, DNA analysis of Māori females and of the
> Pacific rat, and reconstruction of ancient Polynesian canoes, have
> all contributed to recent understanding.

> It is now believed that New Zealand was settled by people from
> East Polynesia – the Southern Cook and Society islands region;
> that they migrated deliberately, setting off in different canoes, at
> different times; and that they first arrived in the late 13th century.
