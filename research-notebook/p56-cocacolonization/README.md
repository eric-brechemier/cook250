> On 15 January 1889, the Coca-Cola Company
> —then known as the Pemberton Medicine Company—
> was originally incorporated in Georgia, US.
> At the time it was incorporated, the company sold
> Pemberton's Indian Queen Hair Dye, Pemberton's Globe Flower Cough Syrup,
> and Pemberton's French Wine Cola
> —a moderately successful health drink made from extracts
> of the coca leaf and kola nut. French Wine Cola was the predecessor
> to the famous Coca-Cola.
>
> Although New Zealand has produced soft drinks since the 1830s,
> it was the in late 1930s that Coca-Cola began to frequent New Zealand shores.
> As Te Ara notes, "Coca-Cola was popularised by American servicemen
> in New Zealand during the Second World War. It was imported ready-made
> from 1939, and made locally from imported concentrate after 1944."
>
> The link between Coca-Cola and American servicemen can be seen
> in this kitschy and now politically-incorrect painting held
> at Archives New Zealand: warart.archives.govt.nz/node/1089.
> Dean Cornwell's "Have a "Coke" = Kia Ora" was painted c.1943-1945,
> and comes from the extensive collection of War Art. (...)
