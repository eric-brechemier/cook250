#### Notes About Date Discrepancies Between the Journals

> *Civil Time, Ship’s Time and the Date Line*
>
> When Joseph Banks recorded events in his journal, he used civil time,
> meaning that each day begins at midnight. So 10 am comes before 2 pm
> on the same day.  However, in the eighteenth century, naval officers used
> nautical or ship’s time rather than civil time. Ship’s time means that each
> day begins at noon [on the previous day]. So 2 pm comes before 10 am. Hence,
> Cook’s journal entries begin with the events of the afternoon, followed by
> midnight, followed by those of the morning, and end with noon.
>
> As Endeavour was sailing westwards, as she crossed 180° longitude on
> 7 October, the journal writers should have adjusted their dates for the
> lost day.  However, they did not do so until they reached Batavia, and were
> told that what they thought was 10 October, 1770, was really 11 October.
> The International Date Line was not established until 1854. (...)
>
> — https://www.captaincooksociety.com/home/detail/october-december-1769

> (...) Till 1805 logs were kept in nautical time; that is to say when they
> were written up at mid-day, that day's entry consisted of the proceedings
> for P.M. of the day before and A.M. of that day. (...) the Nautical day
> commenced at noon, twelve hours earlier than the civil day. The proceedings
> given in the Logs as for 20th October are really the proceedings for the
> afternoon of the 19th, followed by those for the morning of the 20th civil
> time. (...)
>
> We find Cook's journals kept the same way, and in editing the journal for
> the first voyage Admiral Wharton reproduced Cook's own "Explanation" (from
> Journal) which begins "It is necessary to premise by way of explanation,
> that in this journal (except while we lay at St. George's Island) the day
> is supposed to begin and end at noon, as for instance, Friday the 27th May,
> began at noon on Thursday 26th and ended the following noon according to the
> natural day..."
>
> (...)
>
> The log was kept in ship's time, that is, the local apparent time, adjusted
> at intervals to the change of longitude: and by old practice an adjustment
> was made at noon, when the officer taking the latitude sight called
> "Twelve o'clock, Sir," and the Captain said "Make it so," (though the
> actual observations for local time were necessarily made morning and
> afternoon). If it were necessary to establish the accurate time of an
> event we should have to enquire more particularly whether the time of
> the nautical day was on that ship carried on from the noon on which it
> began, or adjusted to the noon on which it ended, or perhaps altered during
> the night from one to the other, as is more or less the present practice in
> merchant ships, though H.M. Navy keeps Standard Time. In default of better
> information we may without serious error (in days of sail) take the recorded
> hour as in the apparent time of the meridian of longitude mentioned in the
> account, and for form's sake apply the equation of time to reduce to civil
> time of the meridian.
>
> If any one should require to go beyond the day and hour of the log, the only
> safe procedure is to reduce to Greenwich Civil Time: after which we can if
> we like argue securely about what would have been the date if the voyage had
> been made the other way round, or if the present rules for change of date had
> been followed then. (...)
