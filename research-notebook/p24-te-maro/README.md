> A memorial is being built by Ngāti Oneone in Gisborne to honour
> their ancestor Te Maro who was shot dead by Captain Cook when he
> first made landfall in New Zealand.
>
> Speaking on behalf of Ngāti Oneone, project designer Nick Tupara says,
> “We want those stories to be told, ones that you can't google, ones that
> the Western academics haven't included in their many volumes about Cook.”
>
> Te Maro was a prominent leader in the area, but as he approached the foreign
> explorer on the beach, Te Maro was shot dead by Captain Cook. (...)

> “He was a graduate of one of our whare wānanga, our whare wānanga called
> Puhi Kai Iti that came here from Hawaiki on our waka."

> “From this spot where we're standing is where he performed the rituals
> he had learnt in that wānanga to assist our iwi and hapū to grow kai and
> sustain themselves,” says Tupara.

> among our people,” said Tupara, adding that his death was still
