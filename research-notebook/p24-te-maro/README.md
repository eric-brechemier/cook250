> A memorial is being built by Ngāti Oneone in Gisborne to honour
> their ancestor Te Maro who was shot dead by Captain Cook when he
> first made landfall in New Zealand.
>
> Speaking on behalf of Ngāti Oneone, project designer Nick Tupara says,
> “We want those stories to be told, ones that you can't google, ones that
> the Western academics haven't included in their many volumes about Cook.”
>
> Te Maro was a prominent leader in the area, but as he approached the foreign
> explorer on the beach, Te Maro was shot dead by Captain Cook. (...)
>
> “He was a graduate of one of our whare wānanga, our whare wānanga called
> Puhi Kai Iti that came here from Hawaiki on our waka."
>
> (...)
>
> “From this spot where we're standing is where he performed the rituals
> he had learnt in that wānanga to assist our iwi and hapū to grow kai and
> sustain themselves,” says Tupara.

> A statement from the Gisborne District Council noted that the place

> Here we heard the other side, of another man, a gardener.

> Speaking on behalf of Tūranga iwi Ngāti Oneone, Nick Tupara says,
> “We also hope that her statement [British High Commissioner to New Zealand
> has issued a formal expression of regret to the iwi of Tūranganui a Kiwa
> for the deaths of at least five Māori at the hands of Captain Cook and
> the crew of the Endeavour] stands for a voice for our community

> community going forward.

> One of the nine Māori shot in the first two days of the Endeavour's visit

>
> Although monuments to Captain Cook have been erected around the country,
> the story of Te Maro has only national attention in recent years.
>
> Tupara says that “Te Maro's job was to grow kai and feed his people
> that was his purpose, and that's a chiefly endeavour. and to ensure
> that his people's well-being was being cared for and through his action,
> they had a way forward, they had a future for their mokopuna and I feel
> we're trying to emulate that.”

> (...) After this I went ashore with a Party of men in the Pinnace and yawl
> accompanied by Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander. We landed abreast of the Ship and
> on the East side of the River just mentioned; but seeing some of the Natives
> on the other side of the River of whom I was desirous of speaking with, and
> finding that we could not ford the River, I order'd the yawl in to carry us
> over, and the pinnace to lay at the Entrance. In the mean time the Indians

> Yards from the water side, leaving 4 boys to take care of the Yawl, which
> we had no sooner left than 4 Men came out of the woods on the other side the
> River, and would certainly have cut her off had not the People in the
> Pinnace discover'd them and called to her to drop down the Stream, which
> they did, being closely persued by the Indians. The coxswain of the Pinnace,
> who had the charge of the Boats, seeing this, fir'd 2 Musquets over their
> Heads; the first made them stop and Look round them, but the 2nd they took
> no notice of; upon which a third was fir'd and kill'd one of them upon the
> Spot just as he was going to dart his spear at the Boat. At this the other 3
> stood motionless for a Minute or two, seemingly quite surprised; wondering,
> no doubt, what it was that had thus kill'd their Comrade; but as soon as
> they recovered themselves they made off, dragging the Dead body a little way
> and then left it. Upon our hearing the report of the Musquets we immediately
> repair'd to the Boats, and after viewing the Dead body we return'd on board.
