> In the early 1970s members of the Polynesian Voyaging Society in Hawaii
> searched for Polynesians who remembered traditional navigation techniques.
> At first they thought there was no one, but they eventually tracked down
> Mau Piailug from the island of Satawal in Micronesia, who could navigate
> the open ocean without instruments. He guided the Hōkūle‘a from Hawaii to
> Tahiti and back using a star compass, shown here. Mau Piailug shared his
> knowledge with Nainoa Thompson, who became the first Polynesian in centuries
> to use celestial navigation on long distance ocean voyaging when he repeated
> the journey in the same vessel in 1980.

> Te kapehu whetū – the Māori star compass – divides the 360 degrees
> around a canoe in the open ocean into different whare (houses).
> The location of these houses depends on where the sun, moon and stars
> set and rise. The navigator then attempts to keep the canoe on a course
> relative to these observations.
