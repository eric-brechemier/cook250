> From Hawaiki to Hawaiki
>
> Hawaiki, the legendary homeland of the Maori peoples
> of Aotearoa/New Zealand, from whence we migrated to
> this land about 1000 years ago. Where is Hawaiki?
> Many have speculated that it lies somewhere in the
> Pacific, somewhere in Polynesia.
>
> Modern scholars tell us that more than 15,000 years ago
> we lived on the land now called China, and that from there
> we travelled via Taiwan and the Philippines to Indonesia.
> About 6,000 to 9,000 years ago we moved on through Melanesia
> and reached Fiji about 3,500 years ago. From there to Samoa
> and on to the Marquesas 2,500 years ago. Perhaps that was the
> limit of our eastern migration for it seems that 1,700 years
> ago we turned South West to Tahiti, thence to the Cook Islands
> and to Aotearoa/New Zealand. Where then is the legendary
> homeland of Hawaiki?
>
> Our tribal stories tell us that at the death of our bodies
> our spirits live on and journey back to Hawaiki; to the meeting
> place of the spirits at Great Hawaiki, Long Hawaiki, Hawaiki
> Far Away. Life then is a journey from Hawaiki to Hawaiki, the
> spiritual homeland of the Maori. And Hawaiki is with us always,
> carried in our hearts through thousands of generations, and
> thousands of years of migration; carried also through the lifetime
> of a single heart wherever it may journey.
