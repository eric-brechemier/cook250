> *The Kowhai New Zealand's National Flower* by Alan Jolliffe
>
> If there is one flowering plant that New Zealanders call their
> National Flower it is the Kowhai. It grows naturally throughout
> the dryer areas of New Zealand and because it is so popular it is
> planted in almost every garden.
>
> (...)
>
> The most distinctive feature is its flower. Each spring the large
> bright yellow flowers appear in pendulous clusters of 5-7 on naked
> branches. These showy clusters appear in great profusion. Individual
> flowers are up to 6cm long and the colour is a golden sulphur yellow.
> The calyx, which holds the petals in place, is a yellowish/green colour
> that adds further colour to the flowers.
>
> Tuis and bellbirds love these flowers and visit them to drink the sweet
> nectar. Unfortunately these birds, in their haste, tear the flowers
> to pieces.
>
> (...)
>
> The Kowhai is the best known NZ Native flowering tree and one of the most
> beautiful. As a small tree it is excellent in many small gardens where
> light foliage cover is required and a burst of colour in spring when it
> smothers itself with blooms.
>
> (...)
>
> Maori also recognised the Kowhai as an important plant. Its medicinal
> properties were explored by the Maori and poultices were made from bark
> and applied to wounds and tumours. An infusion of barks (a tea) from the
> Kowhai and manuka was used to treat internal pain, bruises and broken limbs.
> Wood ash from the Kowhai was used to treat ringworm.
>
> The Maori are said to have regulated the planting of potatoes by the
> flowering time of the Kowhai.
>
> The wood of the Kowhai is valuable as is it is very durable. Logs have
> been used straight from the bush and used in construction without any
> special treatment.
>
> As an individual tree the Kowhai is a superb garden plant. It is small
> enough for even the smallest of gardens but it is large enough to make
> an impact. As a garden tree there is none better in spring.
>
> (...)
>
> Plantings of the Kowhai should be encouraged throughout NZ and in other
> places around the world to ensure this icon of New Zealand plants is able
> to show us its best each spring.
