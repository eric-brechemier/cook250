### Māori Place Names

#### Our Place Names

> The language of our place names creates a striking snapshot
> of New Zealand's history. The map below is coloured based on
> whether the place name contains Māori or English. As you can
> see Māori names dominate the North Island outside of Auckland and
> Wellington, while the South Island has predominantly English names.
