#### First Sightings

On 17 December 1642, they spotted the first signs of life on the island:
"smoke ascending from fires made by the natives".

> **Item the 17th.**
>
> In the morning at sunrise we were about one mile from the shore;
> in various places we saw smoke ascending from fires made by the natives;
> the wind then being south and blowing from the land we again tacked
> to eastward. At noon Latitude estimated 40° 31', Longitude 190° 47';
> course kept north-east by east, sailed 12 miles; in the afternoon the
> wind being west we held our course east by south along a low-lying shore
> with dunes in good dry weather; we sounded in 30 fathom, black sand,
> so that by night one had better approach this land aforesaid, sounding;
> we then made for this sandy point until we got in 17 fathom, where we cast
> anchor at sunset owing to a calm, when we had the northern extremity of
> this dry sandspit west by north of us; also high land extending to east
> by south; the point of the reef south-east of us; here inside this point
> or narrow sandspit we saw a large open bay upward of 3 or 4 miles wide;
> to eastward of this narrow sandspit there is a sandbank upwards of a mile
> in length with 6, 7, 8 and 9 feet of water above it, and projecting
> east-south-east from the said point. In the evening we had 9° North-East
> variation.

On 18 December 1642, they anchored and decided to send a party to the shore.

> **Item the 18th.**
>
> In the morning we weighed anchor in calm weather; at noon Latitude
> estimated 40° 49', Longitude 191° 41'; course kept east-south-east,
> sailed 11 miles. In the morning before weighing anchor, we had resolved
> with the Officers of the Zeehaan that we should try to get ashore here and
> find a good harbour; and that as we neared it we should send out the pinnace
> to reconnoitre; all which may in extenso be seen from this day's resolution.
>
> In the afternoon our skipper Ide Tiercxz and our pilot-major Francoys
> Jacobsz, in the pinnace, and Supercargo Gilsemans, with one of the second
> mates of the Zeehaan in the latter's cock-boat, went on before to seek a
> fitting anchorage and a good watering-place.
>
> At sunset when it fell a calm we dropped anchor in 15 fathom,
> good anchoring-ground in the evening, about an hour after sunset,
> we saw a number of lights on shore and four boats close inshore,
> two of which came towards us, upon which our own two boats returned on board;
> they reported that they had found no less than 13 fathom water and that,
> when the sun sank behind the high land, they were still about half a mile
> from shore.
>
> When our men had been on board for the space of about one glass the men
> in the two prows began to call out to us in the rough, hollow voice,
> but we could not understand a word of what they said. We however called out
> to them in answer, upon which they repeated their cries several times, but
> came no nearer than a stone shot; they also blew several times on an
> instrument of which the sound was like that of a Moorish trumpet; we then
> ordered one of our sailors (who had some knowledge of trumpet-blowing)
> to play them some tunes in answer. Those on board the Zeehaan ordered their
> second mate (who had come out to India as a trumpeter and had in the
> Mauritius been appointed second mate by the council of that fortress and
> the ships) to do the same; after this had been repeated several times on
> both sides, and as it was getting more and more dark, those in the native
> prows at last ceased and paddled off.
>
> For more security and to be on guard against all accidents we ordered our
> men to keep double watches as we are wont to do when out at sea, and to keep
> in readiness all necessaries of war, such as muskets, pikes and cutlasses.
> We cleaned the guns on the upper-orlop, and placed them again, in order to
> prevent surprises, and be able to defend ourselves if these people should
> happen to attempt anything against us.
>
> Variation 9° North-East.

#### First Murders

> **Item the 19th.**
>
> Early in the morning a boat manned with 13 natives approached to about a
> stone's cast from our ships; they called out several times but we did not
> understand them, their speech not bearing any resemblance to the vocabulary
> given us by the Honourable Governor-General and Councillors of India, which
> is hardly to be wondered at, seeing that it contains the language of the
> Salomonis islands, etc.
>
> As far as we could observe these people were of ordinary height;
> they had rough voices and strong bones, the colour of their skin being
> brown and yellow; they wore tufts of black hair right upon the
> top of their heads, tied fast in the manner of the Japanese at the back of
> their heads, but somewhat longer and thicker, and surmounted by a large,
> thick white feather.
>
> Their boats consisted of two long narrow prows side by side, over which a
> number of planks or other seats were placed in such a way that those above
> can look through the water underneath the vessel: their paddles are upwards
> of a fathom in length, narrow and pointed at the end; with these vessels
> they could make considerable speed.
>
> For clothing, as it seemed to us, some of them wore mats, others cotton
> stuffs; almost all of them were naked from the shoulders to the waist.
>
> We repeatedly made signs for them to come on board of us, showing them
> white linen and some knives that formed part of our cargo. They did not
> come nearer, however, but at last paddled back to shore.
>
> In the meanwhile, at our summons sent the previous evening, the officers of
> the Zeehaan came on board of us, upon which we convened a council and
> resolved to go as near the shore as we could, since there was good
> anchoring-ground here, and these people apparently sought our friendship.
>
> Shortly after we had drawn up this resolution we saw 7 more boats put off
> from the shore, one of which (high and pointed in front, manned with 17
> natives) paddled round behind the Zeehaan while another, with 13 able-bodied
> men in her, approached to within half a stone's throw of our ship; the men
> in these two boats now and then called out to each other; we held up and
> showed them as before white linens, etc., but they remained where they were.

> The skipper of the Zeehaan now sent out to them his quartermaster with her
> cock-boat with six paddlers in it, with orders for the second mates that,
> if these people should offer to come alongside the Zeehaan, they should not
> allow too many of them on board of her, but use great caution and be well on
> their guard.
>
> While the cock-boat of the Zeehaan was paddling on its way to her those in
> the prow nearest to us called out to those who were lying behind the Zeehaan
> and waved their paddles to them, but we could not make out what they meant.
>
> Just as the cock-boat of the Zeehaan had put off from board again those in
> the prow before us, between the two ships, began to paddle so furiously
> towards it that, when they were about halfway slightly nearer to our ship,
> they struck the Zeehaan's cock-boat so violently alongside with the stem of
> their prow that it got a violent lurch, upon which the foremost man in this
> prow of villains with a long, blunt pike thrust the quartermaster Cornelis
> Joppen in the neck several times with so much force that the poor man fell
> overboard. Upon this the other natives, with short thick clubs which we at
> first mistook for heavy blunt parangs, and with their paddles, fell upon
> the men in the cock-boat and overcame them by main force, in which fray
> three of our men were killed and a fourth got mortally wounded through the
> heavy blows.
>
> The quartermaster and two sailors swam to our ship, whence we had sent our
> pinnace to pick them up, which they got into alive. After this outrageous
> and detestable crime the murderers sent the cock-boat adrift, having taken
> one of the dead bodies into their prow and thrown another into the sea.
>
> Ourselves and those on board the Zeehaan seeing this, diligently
> fired our muskets and guns and, although we did not hit any of them, the
> two prows made haste to the shore, where they were out of the reach of shot.
> With our fore upper-deck and bow guns we now fired several shots in the
> direction of their prows, but none of them took effect.
>
> There upon our skipper Ide Tercxsen Holman, in command of our pinnace
> well manned and armed, rowed towards the cock-boat of the Zeehaan
> (which fortunately for us these accursed villains had let adrift) and
> forthwith returned with it to our ships, having found in it one of the men
> killed and one mortally wounded.
>
> We now weighed anchor and set sail, since we could not hope to enter into
> any friendly relations with these people, or to be able to get water or
> refreshments here.
>
> Having weighed anchor and being under sail, we saw 22 prows near the shore,
> of which eleven, swarming with people, were making for our ships.
> We kept quiet until some of the foremost were within reach of our guns,
> and then fired 1 or 2 shots from the gun-room with our pieces, without
> however doing them any harm; those on board the Zeehaan also fired,
> and in the largest prow hit a man who held a small white flag in his hand,
> and who fell down. We also heard the canister-shot strike the prows inside
> and outside, but could not make out what other damage it had done. As soon
> as they had got this volley they paddled back to shore with great speed,
> two of them hoisting a sort of tingang sails. They remained lying near the
> shore without visiting us any further.
>
> About noon skipper Gerrit Jansz and Mr. Gilsemans again came on board of us;
> we also sent for their first mate and convened the council, with whom we
> drew up the resolution following, to wit:
>
> Seeing that the detestable deed of these natives against four men of
> the Zeehaan's crew, perpetrated this morning, must teach us to consider the
> inhabitants of this country as enemies;
>
> that therefore it will be best to sail eastward along the coast, following
> the trend of the land in order to ascertain whether there are any fitting
> places where refreshments and water would be obtainable;
>
> all of which will be found set forth in extenso in this day's resolution.
>
> In this murderous spot (to which we have accordingly given the name of
> Moordenaersbay) we lay at anchor on 40° 50' South Latitude, 191° 30'
> Longitude. From here we shaped our course east-north-east.
>
> At noon Latitude estimated 40° 57', Longitude 191° 41'; course kept south,
> sailed 2 miles.
>
> In the afternoon we got the wind from the west-north-west when, on the
> advice of our steersmen and with our own approval, we turned our course
> north-east by north.
>
> During the night we kept sailing as the weather was favourable, but about
> an hour after midnight we sounded in 25 or 26 fathom, a hard, sandy bottom.
> Soon after the wind went round to north-west, and we sounded in 15 fathom;
> we forthwith tacked to await the day, turning our course to westward,
> exactly contrary to the direction by which we had entered.
>
> Variation 9° 30' North-East.
>
> This is the second land which we have sailed along and discovered.
> In honour of their High Mightinesses the States-General we gave
> Staten Landt, since we deemed it quite possible that this land is part
> of the great Staten Land, though this is not certain. This land seems to
> be a very fine country and we trust that this is the mainland coast of the
> unknown South land. To this course we have given the name of Abel Tasman
> passagie, because he has been the first to navigate it.

Then they spent several days at anchor in a nearby bay, now called Tasman Bay,
waiting with double anchors for a strong storm to pass, then navigating
for days to find [land on all sides][TRAPPED], and no passage in view.

They escaped on the 26th with favorable wind, then navigated away
[along the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand][MORE_LAND]
until they reached the northernmost tip of the North Island on January 4th.

#### More Sightings

> **Item the 5th.**
>
> In the morning we still drifted in a calm, but about 9 o'clock we got a
> slight breeze from the south-east, whereupon with our friends of the
> Zeehaan we deemed it expedient to steer our course for the island before
> mentioned.
>
> About noon we sent to the said island our pinnace with the pilot-major,
> together with the cock-boat of the Zeehaan with Supercargo Gilsemans in it,
> in order to find out whether there was any fresh water to be obtained there.
>
> Towards the evening they returned on board and reported that, having come
> near the land, they had paid close attention to everything and had taken due
> precautions against sudden surprises or assaults on the part of the natives;
>
> that they had entered a safe but small bay, where they had found good fresh
> water, coming in great plenty from a steep mountain, but that, owing to the
> heavy surf on the shore, it was highly dangerous, nay well-nigh impossible
> for us to get water there, that therefore they pulled farther round the
> said island, trying to find some other more convenient water-place elsewhere,
> that on the said land they saw in several places on the highest hills from
> 30 to 35 persons, men of tall stature, so far as they could see from a
> distance, armed with sticks or clubs, who called out to them in a very loud,
> rough voice, certain words which our men could not understand;

<> that these persons, in walking on, took enormous steps or strides.

> As our men were rowing about some few in number now and then showed
> themselves on the hill-tops, from which our men very credibly concluded
> that these natives in this way generally keep in readiness their assegais,
> boats and small arms, after their wonted fashions;

> so that it may fairly be inferred that few, if any, more persons inhabit

> higher up on both sides the running water they saw everywhere square beds
> looking green and pleasant, but owing to the great distance they could not
> discern what kind of vegetables they were.
> It is quite possible that all these persons had their dwellings near the
> said fresh water.
>
> In the bay aforesaid they also saw two prows hauled on shore, one of them
> seaworthy, the other broken, but they nowhere saw any other craft.
>
> Our men having returned on board with the pinnace, we forthwith did our best
> to get near the shore, and in the evening we anchored in 40 fathom,
> good bottom, at a small swivel-gun-shot distance from the coast. We
> forthwith made preparations for taking in water the next day.
>
> The said island is in 34° 25' South Latitude and 190° 40' average Longitude.

> **Item the 6th.**
>
> Early in the morning we sent to the watering-place the two boats, to wit
> ours and the cock-boat of the Zeehaan, each furnished with two pederaroes,
> 6 musketeers, and the rowers with pikes and side-arms, together with our
> pinnace with the pilot-major Francoys Jacobsz and skipper Gerrit Jansz,
> with casks for getting fresh water.
>
> While rowing towards the shore they saw, in various places on the heights,
> a tall man standing with a long stick like a pike, apparently watching our
> men. As they were rowing past he had called out to them in a very loud voice;
>
> when they had got about halfway to the watering-place, between a certain
> point and another large high rock or small island, they found the current
> to run so strongly against the wind that, with the empty boats, they had to
> do their utmost to hold their own;
>
> for which reason the pilot-major and Gerrit Jansz, skipper of the Zeehaan,
> agreed together to abstain from exposing the small craft and the men to such
> great peril, seeing that there was still a long voyage before them and the
> men and the small craft were greatly wanted by the ships. They therefore
> pulled back to the ships, the rather as a heavy surf was rolling on the
> shore near the watering-place.
>
> The breeze freshening, we could easily surmise that they had not been able
> to land, and now made a sign to them from our ship with the furled flag, and
> fired a gun to let them know that they were at liberty to return, but they
> were already on their way back before we signalled to them.
>
> The pilot-major, having come alongside our ship again with the boats,
> reported that owing to the wind the attempt to land there was too dangerous,
> seeing that the sea was everywhere near the shore full of hard rocks without
> any sandy ground, so that they would have greatly imperilled the men and run
> the risk of having the water-casks injured or stove in;
>
> we forthwith summoned the officers of the Zeehaan and the second mates on

Tasman then set hist course further north, leaving New Zealand where neither
he nor any of his men had set foot.
