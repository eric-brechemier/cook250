*Polynesian double hull waka*

> According to many tribal narratives,

> Stories about his exploration on his canoe,
> the Matawhaorua or Matahorua, differ from region to region
> but often feature a fight with a great wheke (octopus).
> Many New Zealand place names, preserved by later generations
> of Māori people, recall his journey.
