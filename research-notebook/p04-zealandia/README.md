> Te Riu-a-Māui literally means the hills, valleys and plains of Māui -
> the great East Polynesian ancestor explorer of the Pacific Ocean.
> Riu means hull (of a canoe), basin (like the Waikato basin), a belly,
> the core (of a body). It is the whole that holds the parts together.
>
> Māui is an ancestor of all Polynesians. He sailed and explored the great
> ocean and caught the fish which he and his crew pulled up. The fish became
> many of the islands we know today. The name Te Riu-a-Māui brings together
> traditional oral narratives and geological science.
>
> The convention with dual names is that the Māori name comes first
> e.g. Aotearoa/New Zealand, Aoraki/Mt Cook.
