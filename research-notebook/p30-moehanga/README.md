##### New Zealand History

> Moehanga of Ngāpuhi became the first recorded Māori visitor to England
> when the whaler Ferret berthed in London. Moehanga (Te Mahanga) had boarded
> the Ferret when it visited the Bay of Islands late in 1805.
>
> While Māori had travelled as far as Tahiti and Australia in the late 18th
> century, Moehanga was the first to reach the northern hemisphere. He took
> a keen interest in the sights and people of London, which had a population
> of more than a million. He met Earl Fitzwilliam and also (he claimed
> subsequently) King George III and Queen Charlotte, who apparently gave
> him tools and money.
>
> Te Mahanga sailed on the Ferret when it left for Port Jackson (Sydney)
> in June. After spending the summer in Sydney, he returned to his home in
> the Bay of Islands in March 1807.
>
> Te Mahanga was still living in the Bay of Islands in 1827, when he was
> described as the uncle of Te Whareumu, the Ngāti Manu leader at Kororāreka
> (now Russell).

> (…) Historian Tony Ballantyne, of the University of Otago, said
> Moehanga was an acute observer and his journey was significant.
>
> “Moehanga’s visit to London can be understood as a part of a long sequence
> of indigenous travellers from the Americas and the Pacific and leaders of
> colonised communities from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean,” he said.
>
> “(They) journeyed to England, seeking to understand its power and culture
> and often with the desire to articulate their own political visions and to
> challenge the profound inequalities of empire.”
>
> Moehanga visited St Paul’s Cathedral, was particularly interested in music
> and culture, but disliked London’s rowdiness.
>
> Moehanga later claimed to have met Queen Charlotte during his visit,
> performing a haka for her. (…)
