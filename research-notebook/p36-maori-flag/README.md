> The Tino Rangatiratanga flag is often referred to as the Māori flag and can
> be used to represent all Māori. Hiraina Marsden, Jan Smith and Linda Munn
> designed the flag in 1990. It uses black, white, and red as national colours
> of New Zealand. The design of the flag references the Māori creation story of
> Rangi and Papa, suggesting the sky, the earth, and the physical realm of
> light and being, which was created when they were separated. (…)

> On 14 December 2009, Prime Minister John Key and Māori Affairs Minister
> Pita Sharples announced that the Māori Tino Rangatiratanga flag was chosen
> to fly from the Auckland Harbour Bridge and other official buildings (such as
> Premier House) on Waitangi Day. The announcement followed a Māori Party–led
> promotion and series of hui on which Māori flag should fly from the bridge.
> 1,200 submissions were received, with 80% of participants in favour of the
> Tino Rangatiratanga flag as they preferred the Māori flag. (…)
