This was the third formal claim of James Cook on New Zealand territory.
It was accompanied by the erection of small stone monuments concealing
durable tokens to prove the anteriority of the British presence to
any other Europeans coming in the future.

> a[s] 5 stout men could do in half an hour and laid in it musquet balls beads
> shot &c. that if perchance any Europeans should find and pull it down they

A second claim had been made on 15 November 1769:

> **Wednesday, 15th In the evening** (...) **At 7 AM** (...)
> 
> Mercury Bay lies in the Latitude of 36°..47' So and in the Longitude of
> 184°.. 4' Wt from the Meridion of Greenwich. (...)
>
> We found thrown upon the Shore in several places in this Bay quantities of
> Iron Sand which is brought down out of the Country by almost every little
> frish water brook. this proves that there must be of that ore not far inland
> — Neither the Inhabitants of this place or any other where we have been know
> the use of Iron, or set the least Value upon it, prefering the most trifleing
> thing we could give them to a nail or any sort of Iron tools. Before we left
> this Bay we cut out upon one of the trees near the watering place, the Ships
> Name, date &Ca and after displaying the English Colours I took formal
> posession of the place in the name of His Majesty —

And according to the Journal of Sydney Parkinson, the first claim had been made
in different circumstanceson, on the second day after setting foot on the coast
of New Zealand:

> **Early on the morning of the 10th,** the long-boat, pinnace, and yaul,
> went on shore again; landed near the river where they had been the night
> before, and attempted to find a watering place. Several of the natives came
> toward them, and, with much entreating, we prevailed on some of them to
> cross the river, to whom we gave several things, which they carried back to
> their companions on the other side of the river, who seemed to be highly
> pleased with them, and testified their joy by a war-dance. Appearing to be
> so pacifically disposed, our company went over to them, and were received in
> a friendly manner. Some of the natives were armed with lances, and others
> with a kind of stone truncheon; through the handle of it was a string, which
> they twisted round the hand that held it when they attempted to strike at
> any person. [See pl. XV.] We would have purchased some of their weapons,
> but could not prevail on them to part with them on any terms. One of them,
> however, watched an opportunity, and snatched a hanger from us; our people
> resented the affront by firing upon them, and killed three of them on the
> spot, but the rest, to our surprise, did not appear to be intimidated at the
> sight of their expiring countrymen, who lay weltering in their blood; nor
> did they seem to breathe any revenge upon the occasion; attempting only to
> wrest the hanger out of the mans hand that had been shot, and to take the
> weapons that belonged to their other two deceased comrades; which having
> effected, they quietly departed. After having taken possession of the
> country, in form, for the king, our company embarked, and went round the bay
> in search of water again, and to apprehend, if possible, some of the natives,
> to gain farther information of them respecting the island. (...)

After I had thus prepared the way for setting
up the post we took it up to the highest
part of the Island, and after fixing it fast
in the ground hoisted thereon the Union flag
and I dignified this Inlet with the name of
Queen _Charlotte's_Sound_ and took formal possession
of it and the Adjacent lands in the Name and
for the use of his Majesty. We then drank Her
Majesty's health in a Bottle of wine and gave
the empty bottle to the old man who had
attended us up the hill whichto he was
highly pleased. Whilst the post was setting up
